## 🏗️ Architecture

```sh
Client → API Gateway → [User/Product/Order/Cart/Payment Services] → MongoDB
                    ↓
              Notification Service → Redis Queue → Email/SMS/WhatsApp
                    ↓
              Payment Service → Stripe API
                    ↓
              Cart Service ↔ Product Service (stock validation)
```

For detailed architecture information, see [Architecture Documentation](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
